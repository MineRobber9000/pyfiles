# pyfiles

These are random python files that were in my homedir on tilde.team. As a part of me trying to maybe use less space sometime(tm), I've decided to toss them in this PR and open-source them. Anything in this directory, to the extent that I can license it as such, is licensed MIT and available for anyone to use. (If you can find anything useful here, that is.)

Note that you might need text files from [txtfiles][] or even [testfiles][] to run these scripts as-is.
