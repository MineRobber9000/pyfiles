# pyfiles

These are random python files that were in my homedir on tilde.team. As a part of me trying to maybe use less space sometime(tm), I've decided to toss them in this PR and open-source them. Anything in this directory, to the extent that I can license it as such, is licensed MIT and available for anyone to use. (If you can find anything useful here, that is.)
